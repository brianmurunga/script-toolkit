# Personal Script Toolkit üõ†Ô∏è

A collection of useful PowerShell, Bash and CMD scripts I've created or curated for system management, automation and cybersecurity tasks.

## üìÇ powershell/

- ### üîç `user_account_monitor.ps1`
Monitors the Windows Security log for new user account creation events (Event ID 4720) and shows a popup alert if one is detected. Helpful for identifying unexpected or unauthorized account creation.
### üö´ `disable_wsiaccount.ps1`
Disables the `WsiAccount` ‚Äî a Web Sign-In account sometimes created by Windows automatically, usually unnecessary on personal laptops.
